The sport is goverened by FIFA internationally which is the main organization. FIFA(Fédération Internationale de Football Association) was formed in 1904 to oversee and organize international football competitions. FIFA is a non-profit so it invests most of the money made back into the development of the sport which is probably one of the reasons the sport has been so successful. Between 2019-2022 FIFA is estimated to have generated $7.6 billion in revenue through marketing, television and licensing rights for major events like the World Cup. 

## Rules
One of the main rules of soccer/football is the limited use of hands. Unless you are the goalie or doing a throw-in, you use your hands on the ball. A throw-in is taken when the ball crosses a sideline and leaves the field. The two basic soccer rules for a proper throw-in are to have both feet on the ground and to
throw the ball with both hands over the head. There are also fouls in this game. A player cannot kick, trip, jump at, charge, strike, push, hold, or spit at an opponent. The winner of the game is determined by the team with the most amount of goals scored. 
### Advanced Rules
Offside is a postion that is illegal. A player is in an offside position if: he is nearer to his opponents’ goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent. There are two types of free kicks in soccer – direct and indirect free kicks. With a direct free kick, the player taking the kick can score directly, without the ball touching another player. However, in an indirect free kick, the ball must touch another player before a goal can be scored.
